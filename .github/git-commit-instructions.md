First Line: Provide a concise summary (maximum 60 characters) starting with one of the following prefixes:

fix!:
test:
refactor!:
feat!:
docs:
style:
perf:
ci:
build:
revert:
chore:

Note: The optional exclamation mark (!) indicates a breaking change, if it is used.

After the prefix, if the commit affects only one file, begin with the file name followed by a dash, then start the summary with an uppercase letter. If the commit affects multiple files, simply start the summary with an uppercase letter.

Second Line: Leave blank.

Third Line and Beyond: Provide a summary as you normally would, formatted as a list with each item starting with a dash (-). When referencing C# method names, include parentheses (e.g., MethodName()) for clarity.
